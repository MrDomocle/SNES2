# Space shooter game for SNES
This is my first major project for the SNES, written in assembly using ca65.  
It's written from scratch - I didn't use libraries that add a lot of functionality that I would otherwise code for myself.

## Resources I used
* The docs to ca65, the 6502/65816 assembler I use 
https://www.cc65.org/doc/ca65.html  
* Console register docs (love the formatting in this one)  
https://wiki.superfamicom.org/registers  
* Wesley Aptekar-Cassels' guide:
